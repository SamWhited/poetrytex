# PoetryTeX

**PoetryTeX** is a TeX package designed to aid in the formatting of anthologies
of poetry and other writings.

## Download

Development of this package occurs primarily on
[SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~samwhited/poetrytex).
For now, issues should be submitted to the old [issue
tracker](https://github.com/SamWhited/poetrytex/issues) until I decide where to
move them.
Patches should be submitted to the [mailing
list](https://lists.sr.ht/~samwhited/poetrytex).

The current release version of PoetryTeX is available from
[CTAN](http://ctan.org/pkg/poetrytex).
